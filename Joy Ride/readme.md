# Joy Ride - Project Overview
This is a quick, simple project that gives you a chance to write code that controls a simulated car as you get familiar with the Workspaces you'll be using throughout this Nanodegree program. This project has three parts (but you will only submit part three).

## Part One - Drag Race: 
In this part, you'll write code that lets a car jump over a grove of trees. This might not be a common scenario for a self-driving car, but it will get you familiar with the programming interface.
## Part Two - Circular Track: 
In this part, you'll write code that lets a car navigate a circular track. In doing so you'll explore the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.
## Part Three - Parallel Park: 
In this part, you'll write a sequence of instructions that successfully parallel parks a car. In a real car, you obviously wouldn't be able to try repeatedly and hit other cars while you perfect your parking, but in this project, you can try as many times as you need to!

## Tip
For Part Three, the simulator contains a little bit of noise each time you launch it. To help account for this, consider spending a second or two of time traveling slowly forward in the simulator before reversing into your parallel parking. You should also consider using a fairly low vehicle velocity at all times.
