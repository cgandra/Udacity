# Implement Matrix Class

## Project Instructions

1. matrix.py - This contains the beginnings of a Matrix class (which you will complete) as well as some helper functions zeroes and identity. This is the file you will be doing most of your work in.
2. matrix_playground.ipynb - A notebook that imports your Matrix class and calls the test code. You may find it useful to use this notebook as a place to use the matrix math code you will write in matrix.py.
3. matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb - A Jupyter notebook with a glossary, explanation of matrix notation and list of matrix equations. Use this as a reference when filling out the methods in the Matrix class!

Other Files (feel free to ignore). 
1. test.py - Contains test code which demonstrates the expected functionality of your code.
